# Welcome to this CDK JavaScript project!

This application uses the AWS CDK to create a serverless API, using API Gateway, Lambda and DynamoDB

The requirements are:

- An endpoint to POST products to a database */products* **COMPLETE**
- An endpoint to GET a product by ID */products/:productId* **COMPLETE**
- An endpoint to GET ALL products containing tags */products/search?tags=tag1,tag2* **INCOMPLETE**


## Outstanding items

- Use Joi to validate the paylood meets the business requirements *currently using a temp helper function*
- Complete implementation of the search by tags endpoint, time permitting.

## Running and Deploying

- In the root of the project, run `npm install`
- Navigate to the handlers directory and run `npm install`
- Back at the root, you can run `cdk synth` to view the CloudFormation template generated by this stack
- To deploy, run `cdk deploy --profile <profile if not default>`
- Log into your AWS console and view the API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB
